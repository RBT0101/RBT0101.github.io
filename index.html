    <h1><u>What personality does each zodiac have?</u></h1>
    <h2><u>Aries</u></h2>
        <p>
            Aries are enthusiastic individuals and they are often passionate about life. People who are born with this zodiac
            are bold and independent, fighting and facing obstacles bravely in their lives. Also, most Aries tend to
            play basketball and other rigorous sports like soccer, tennis, and handball. However, Aries are known to be stubborn
            and this can easily hurt other people's feeling. 
        </p>

    <h2><u>Taurus</u></h2>
        <p>
            People who are Taurus like to dominate conversation when they talk with friends and their acquaintances. Most
            Taurus have very impressive aesthetic and they enjoy gobbling up foods. Taurus likes to exercise and socialize
            with people around them.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Gemini</u></h2>
        <p>
            Geminis are the most clever of all zodiac signs but these people are moody and lazy. They are also good at
            socializing with other people and are food lovers like Taurus. Because of their mood swings, Geminis are often
            not credible amongst their friends.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Cancer</u></h2>
        <p>
            Most Cancers are introverts and they rarely want to bring attention to themself publicly. They like to observe
            other people and gossip with their friends. These people are known to be very kind and heart-warming. They are
            also generous to their family as well.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Leo</u></h2>
        <p>
            Leos are always self-centered and they are not empathetic towards others. They like to have attention on themselves
            and are very competitive. Leos always desire to get what they want, and if they don't get it, they turn jealous.
            However, Leos are loyal friends and they will promise what they do no matter what happens.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Virgo</u></h2>
        <p>
                Virgo is very similar to Cancer in that they love their family and want to treat them as best as possible.
                However, when Virgo begins to hate people, they will remember this grudge for a while! 
        </p>
    <h2><u>Libra</u></h2>
        <p>
            Libras are very independent but they have very little patience. Most Libras are extroverts and are among the best
            at socializing with people. They are great friends to hang out with and have conversations with. However, their
            impulse may get out of control.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Scorpio</u></h2>
        <p>
            Scorpios are considered the most dangerous zodiac in this list because they can hold the grudges between people
            for their whole life! Despite that they could be friends, these people are likely to betray your friendship and
            backstab you at the time you need them.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Sagittarius</u></h2>
    <p>
        Sagittarius people are very honest with their emotions and they care about people around them more than themselves.
        They are ambitious and open-minded, so feel free to speak out about your issues!
    </p>
    <h2><u>Capricorn</u></h2>
        <p>
            Capricorns can always think out of the box and their method of solving different problems are unconventional.
            They are the "bizarre kids" that we see in the classroom. These people are mostly introverts and like to stay
            alone.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Aquarius</u></h2>
        <p>
            Aquarius is a very mature zodiac and they like partners and people who are also mature. They are very realistic
            and open-minded about life. Being with Aquarius delivers is equivalent to exploring the great adventures! However,
            some Aquarius are not faithful and are lazy.
        </p>
    <h2><u>Pisces</u></h2>
        <p>
            Although Pisces do not have any natural talent, their generosity makes them the best zodiac to have friends with him.
            They can get along with pretty much anyone and are always forgiving. These people do not take grudge seriously and
            are always looking forward to live a better life.
